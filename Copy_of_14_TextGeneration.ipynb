        "ANSWER: because calling this function is actually calling the function 3 times (once for the number and once for each of the two numbers lower) you can work up from the base cases to a given number to find out how many times it calls the function. Ex. f(2) will be called once for f(2) but will also be called once for f(1) and once for f(0) so it is called 3 total times. Using this logic to move all the way up the chain to f(17) you see the function is called 5167 times."
